Abstract:

In this talk I will discuss of reproducibility in general, why it
matters for good science, the differences to replicability, and the
challenges aspects to reproducing scientific computations.  I will
also discuss the practice of how we conduct science, how and why we
write, submit and review research papers, how and why we write, share
and publish research software, and the connection between these two.
Although not an expert in the area of tracking data analysis, I will
try to shed some light on particular challenges for reproducibility
of tracking data analysis, and try to formulate some recommendations.
